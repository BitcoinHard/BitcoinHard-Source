X11 is a widely used hashing algorithm created by Dash core developer Evan Duffield. X11’s chained hashing algorithm utilizes a sequence of 

eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the proof-of-work. This is so that the processing distribution is fair and coins will be distributed 

in much the same way Bitcoin’s were originally. X11 was intended to make ASICs much more difficult to create, thus giving the currency plenty 

of time to develop before mining centralization became a threat. This approach was largely successful; as of early 2016, ASICs for X11 now 

exist and comprise a significant portion of the network hashrate, but have not resulted in the level of centralization present in Bitcoin.

X11 is the name of the chained proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that was introduced in Dash (launched January 2014 as “Xcoin”). It was partially 

inspired by the chained-hashing approach of Quark, adding further “depth” and complexity by increasing the number of hashes, yet it differs 

from Quark in that the rounds of hashes are determined a priori instead of having some hashes being randomly picked.

The X11 algorithm uses multiple rounds of 11 different hashes (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo), 

thus making it one of the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic hashes in use by modern cryptocurrencies.

---MINING---

Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as BitcoinHard refers to the process of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult

problems as a method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining creates new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. 

Mining is possible on a range of hardware. BitcoinHard  implements an algorithm known as X11, which the miner must solve in order to earn rewards.

The simplest and most general hardware available for mining is the general purpose Asic.

Finally, ASICs can perform a single operation only. A number of X11 ASICs are now available on the market, 

which are quickly making CPU and GPU mining uneconomic due to the increased difficulty of hashing arising from the rapidly increasing hash rate.

The result is a currency which is more secure against brute force attacks on the BitcoinHard blockchain.

---MASTERNODE---

BitcoinHard, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain.

This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both BitcoinHard and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW).

Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain.

If all the other people running the software agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded.

BitcoinHard works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a two-tier network. The second tier is powered by masternodes (Full Nodes),

which enable financial privacy (PrivateSend), instant transactions (InstantSend), and the decentralized governance and budget system. Because this second tier is so important,
 
masternodes are also rewarded when miners discover new blocks. The breakdown is as follows: 30% of the block reward goes to the miner, 70% goes to masternodes.

---Advantages of X11----

Increased confidence and safety for currencies
The increased complexity and sophistication of the chained algorithm provides enhanced levels of security and less uncertainty for a digital currency,

compared to single-hash PoW solutions that are not protected against security risks like SPOF (Single Point Of Failure). For example,

a possible but not probable computing breakthrough that “breaks” the SHA256 hash could jeopardize the entire Bitcoin network

until the network shifts through a hard fork to another cryptographic hash.

In the event of a similar computing breakthrough, a digital currency using the X11 PoW would continue to function securely unless all 11 hashes were broken simultaneously.

Even if some of the 11 hashes were to prove unreliable, there would be adequate warning for a currency using X11

to take measures and replace the problematic hashes with other more reliable hashing algorithms.

Given the speculative nature of digital currencies and their inherent uncertainties as a new field, the X11 algorithm can provide

increased confidence for its users and potential investors that single-hash approaches cannot. Chained hashing solutions,

like X11, provide increased safety and longevity for store of wealth purposes, investment diversification

and hedging against risks associated with single-hash currencies plagued by SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).
